<h2>Electron-beam induced excitations in nanomaterials</h2>
    
    <img src="/und.research.github.io/publications/plasmon/eb.jpg" alt="Electron-beam induced plasmon and reactions" class="center">
    
    <p>We work on understanding electron-beam induced excitations in nanomaterials. One of the projects targets investigating the plasmon response of noble-metal nanoparticles, such as Ag and Au, and how to use the plasmon to carry out excitation energy and quantum information transfer and storage as well as generating hot electrons to promote chemical reactions. The other project centers on using electron-beam to control the diffusion of doped atoms in the graphene nanoflakes.
